This is poky with joshuagl's usrmerge patchset applied and an
experimental meta-flatpak layer for ostree/flatpak support.

Common (unmodified) targets (from poky) are:
    core-image-minimal
    core-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-ide-support

New flatpak-specific targets are:

    - flatpak-runtime-image:
          core-image-minimal with usrmerge and ostree/flatpak support
    - flatpak-sdk-image:
          flatpak-runtime-image + development support

The runtime image is meant to be used on target devices. The SDK image
is a flatpak SDK runtime for producing (off device) flatpaks for the
runtime image.

See README.flatpak-test for more detailed instruction on how to test
this whole shebang.
